### Overview

This is a static site built using Astro as the meta-framework/static site generator and leverages React components for reactivity and animation. It integrates with EmailJS to help to send emails using client-side technologies only that can create an auto replay email template.

The site contains my bio which gives a glimpse into my professional background, skills, and projects. It includes a collection of my projects, contact links, and other relevant information to provide an overview of my skills and experience.

To achieve a sleek design with a glassy effect associated with smooth animation, the website is styled using scoped CSS combined with Framer Motion which adaptive the Island Architech to selectively render Javascript.

Overall, the Portfolio project showcases a combination of cutting-edge features where I can take advantage of new modern web technologies while helping me demonstrate my skills which build on a sound foundation of programming as well as impressively express my taste in design.

### Key Features
