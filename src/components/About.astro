          <span>
            I am a fresher web developer based in HCM City, Vietnam, who is
            enthusiast for modern technologies with a drive for problem-solving
            in creative ways to shipping beautiful and performance websites on
            time.
          </span>
          <span>
            I will graduate from my 2nd bachelor's degree in IT at HCM
            University of Information Technology next month. However I consider
            myself as self-taught on web development with a strong discipline
            for learning, improving and evolving.
          </span>
          <span>
            In addition to my web development skills, I possess a great affinity
            for UI and graphic design. Additionally, I enjoy camping,
            meditation, traveling, and photography.

            After 4 years of leading a marketing team and gaining a strong
            background in the field, I have come to truly understand that the
            naturally strong attachment between content and website architecture
            is inseparable.
          </span>
          <span>
            In the constantly changing world of digital marketing, creating good
            content and implementing SEO tactics that focus solely on keyword
            research and on-page optimization is no longer enough to achieve
            desired targets. Optimizing a website's technical infrastructure and
            architecture also plays a crucial role in determining website
            visibility and search engine indexability.
          </span>
          <span>
            I love coding because it constantly challenges me to learn new
            things. Building websites from well-thought-out designs is an
            amazing journey where I can implement all my innovative ideas with a
            user-centric approach. Creating digital experiences that are both
            intuitive and attractive is incredibly fulfilling.
