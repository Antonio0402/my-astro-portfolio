      <span>A bit about me</span>
      <div>
        <span>
          I am a junior web developer based in HCM City, Vietnam, who is
          enthusiast for modern technologies with a drive for problem-solving in
          creative ways to shipping beautiful and performance websites on time.
        </span>
        <span>
          I will graduate from my 2nd bachelor's degree in IT at HCM University
          of Information Technology next month. However I consider myself as
          self-taught on web development with a strong discipline for learning,
          improving and evolving.
        </span>
        <span>
          In addition to my web development skills, I possess a great affinity
          for UI and graphic design. Additionally, I enjoy camping, meditation,
          traveling, and photography.

      <span>In a bit of both worlds</span>
      <span>Marketing & Web Dev</span>
      <div>
        <span>
          After 4 years of leading a marketing team and gaining a strong
          background in the field, I have come to truly understand that the
          naturally strong attachment between content and website architecture
          is inseparable.
        </span>
        <span>
          In the constantly changing world of digital marketing, creating good
          content and implementing SEO tactics that focus solely on keyword
          research and on-page optimization is no longer enough to achieve
          desired targets. Optimizing a website's technical infrastructure and
          architecture also plays a crucial role in determining website
          visibility and search engine ranking.
        </span>
        <span>
          I love coding because it constantly challenges me to learn new things.
          Building websites from well-thought-out designs is an amazing journey
          where I can implement all my innovative ideas with a user-centric
          approach. Creating digital experiences that are both intuitive and
          attractive is incredibly fulfilling.
